1. Find transactions from Mercury that don't have receipts attached, and list them
2. Search Gmail for receipts matching the merchant and date of each transaction
3. For found emails, verify the merchant and transaction date match
4. If a match is found, forward the email to receipts@mercury.com，转发需要把附件带上，并且要以 ethan@vm0.ai 作为发件人
5. For transactions without matching receipts, notify Ethan on Slack
